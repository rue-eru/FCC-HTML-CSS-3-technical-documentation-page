## 🎨 About the Project

This is the first project that required media query that means it needed to be responsive for PC and mobile device that's why the design is simple. All the focus was on responsiveness. Right now I see a lot of flaws and amused how it only used HTML and CSS. Just by scrolling through it I want to add at least up button as you may see on the attached gif. Also I vividly remember that it felt like a torture to resize all the elements and make it responsive. It took a lot of time to learn and get used to. These were the days!
